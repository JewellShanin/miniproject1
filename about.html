		<h2>BATANES - The Land of the True Insulars</h2>

        <br>
		<p>The Province of Batanes is an archipelago province in the region of Cagayan Valley, Philippines. It is the northernmost province of the Philippines and is also the smallest province, both in terms of population and land area. The provincial capital is Basco on Batan Island.
           The province is a tiny archipelago, consisting of 10 islands. Three of these are inhabited: Batan, the main island and the second largest, Itbayat, the largest and Sabtang. The rest are Mavudis, Misanga, Ditarem, Siayan, Dinem, Vuhos, Adekey. The northernmost island is Mavudis, also known as Yami. The indigenous people of Batanes are called Ivatans who are nationally acclaimed as the True Insulares. With the passage of time, they have managed to keep the purity of their genes. Batanes boasts its local attractions like historic churches, unique architecture of Ivatan houses, intermittent sandy beaches, countryside panoramic views, rock formations and rugged terrains.
        </p>
        <p>GEOGRAPHY: Batanes is the smallest province of the Philippines, with a land mass only one third of that of Metro Manila. Its vast territorial waters of 4,500 square kilometers is around 20 times more than its land area of only about 229 square kilometers of which 31.5 square kilometers represent the combined land areas of the 7 uninhabited islets. The island group is located about 162 kilometres (101 mi) north of Luzon and about 190 kilometres (120 mi) south of Taiwan, separated from the Babuyan Islands of Cagayan Province, Luzon, by the Balintang Channel and from Taiwan by the Bashi Channel.</p>

        <h2>Facts About Batanes</h2>

        <br>
        <h3>The Islands</h3>
        <p>Batanes is actually a group of 10 volcanic islands, three of which are inhabited, namely Batan (where the provincial capital of Basco is located), Itbayat, and Sabtang.
           The fourth island, Ivuhos (also known as Ibahos), is occasionally inhabited by families tending cattle. The other uninhabited islands of Batanes are North, Yami, Mavudis, Siayan, Di-nem, and Dequey.
           Separation of these islands paved the way for the formation of two distinct dialects of the Ivatan language. Those who live in the islands of Batan and Sabtang mainly speak  Ivatan while those in Itbayat speak the Itbayat dialect.</p>
        
        <h3>Aman Dangat</h3>
        <p>Also known as “Kenan,”  Aman Dangat was a datu of Malakdang in Sabtang Island who led a revolt against Spaniards in 1791.
           Aman Dangat was a staunch Ivatan leader who continued to govern his people in accordance with indigenous custom laws even after the Spanish rule was established in Batanes on June 26, 1783.
           When non-Ivatan Filipinos working under the Spanish government took supplies and timber from his people without just compensation, Aman Dangat protested, but his men were put in chains.
           As a result, he led over a hundred men from Sabtang to attack their oppressors in 1791, killing at least 7 Spanish government agents in the end.
           Eventually, Aman Dangat and his men were outnumbered by the stronger Spanish forces. They were convicted and their valuables confiscated.
           Aman Dangat was later executed by hanging in September of 1731. The people of Sabtang, meanwhile, were exiled in the districts of San Felix and San Vicente in Ivana for the next fifty years (1791-1841).</p>
        
        <h3>Pacita Abad and Fundacion Pacita</h3>
        <p>Pacita Abad is a world-renowned painter and a certified pride of Batanes.
           Born in Basco in 1946, Pacita earned a BA degree in political science at the University of the Philippines but was later forced to leave for America in 1970 due to her political activism against the Marcos dictatorship.
           She studied law in San Francisco but she soon shifted gears and started a prolific thirty-year career as a painter. Her works are characterized by “vibrant color, constant change, experimentation, and development.”
           As an internationally recognized Asian-American artist, Pacita was able to create over 5,000 artworks, travel to more than 50 countries, worked in 6 continents and even paint a 55-meter long bridge in Singapore before she died of cancer in 2004.
           Once her home studio, Fundacion Pacita in Batanes was refurbished by Budget Secretary Butch Abad, Pacita’s brother, and is now the most expensive and luxurious hotel in the province.
           Although costly, the hotel uses part of the proceeds to support young Ivatan artists and heritage conservation projects in Batanes.</p>

        <h3>Provincial Song & Symbols</h3>
        <p>“Kalusan” is officially the provincial song of Batanes. It is a rowing song first recorded and popularized by Gov. Otto Scheerer in 1909.
            By definition, “kalusan” is a working song sung by Ivatans as they work in the fields, row, or cut timber. This song is usually started by a song leader (vachi) followed by workers who would sing the rest of the song.
            In accordance with legislation passed on November 28, 1988, the following are the approved provincial symbols of Batanes:</p>
            
        <p>Provincial Tree: Aryus</p>
        <p>Provincial Flower: Rahakut (native white orchid)</p>
        <p>Provincial Bird: Aradiwangan, Voyit (Ivatan dove)</p>
        <p>Provincial Fish: Mayasang</p>
        <p>Provincial Air Plant: Humahum (fern)</p>

        <h3>The Origin of the Honesty Coffee Shop</h3>
        <p>As the name suggests, the Honesty Coffee Shop in Ivana started as a simple store which served hot water and coffee to people traveling to and from the island of Sabtang. The owner,  Elena Castaño-Gabilo, a retired public school teacher, built the first store in the middle of the town with the help of her spouse, Jose.
           The original store offered coffee, sugar, and hot water every morning. There was also a stove available for those who wanted to cook rice or heat water. Mrs. Elena would come early to prepare all of these and return only at noontime to check on the store.</p>

        <h3>The Oldest Stone House: House of Dakay</h3>
        <p>Built during the Spanish colonial era, Ivatan stone houses survived some of the strongest typhoons and have been considered a cultural treasure of the province.
           The oldest stone house in Batanes was built in 1877. Also known as the House of Estrella, the “House of Dakay” was named after its inheritor, Jose “Dakay” Estrella. The structure was originally built for his aunt, Luisa Estrella, through a Bayanihan (voluntarism) system locally referred to as qapañidungan.</p>
           House of Dakay is still in its original form, except for its thatched cogon roof which is normally replaced every 25 to 30 years. It has survived various natural calamities including a Magnitude 8.3 earthquake on September 13, 1918, a disaster that brought the entire town of Ivana to the ground.
        
        <h3>Basco Lighthouse and WWII Ruins</h3>
        <p>One of the most popular landmarks in the province, the Basco Lighthouse in Naidi Hills is actually one of the three lighthouses proposed by former Congressman Florencio Abad.
           The lighthouses (the other two are located in Sabtang and Mahatao) also serve as tourist attractions.
           The present-day Basco lighthouse stands where the first lighthouse in the area was built. Not too far from the lighthouse are some WWII ruins. These structures were once part of the American telegraph facilities which connected the province to the central government.
           Built in 2003, the Basco lighthouse towers at about 66 ft. and was made with stone or rubble masonry.</p>

        <h3>Batanes’ WWII Tunnel</h3>
        <p>Also known as the Dipnaysupuan Japanese tunnels, the Batanes tunnels in Batan island were built as part of the Japanese forces’ military fortification. During World War II, local Ivatans–including children–were ordered by the Japanese soldiers to build the tunnels.
           In an I-Witness documentary, survivors Lolo Daniel and Lolo Luis recounted how they built the tunnels which are equipped with five doors. Although they were not tortured while digging, the fear of being killed forced them to work efficiently.
           As of this writing, no official historical or geological study has been conducted yet, although the local government is working towards preserving the tunnels and protecting them from looters.</p>

        <h3>Batanes ‘Ghost Barangay’ -- Song Song Ruins</h3>
        <p>Located 23 kilometers from Basco, Sitio Song Song is a deserted place, one that could qualify as a ‘ghost barangay’.
           The stone houses in Song Song were abandoned in the 1950s when a tidal wave hit the island of Batan. What has been left is a cluster of roofless shells of old stone houses.</p>
