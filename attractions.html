                            the beach's shore is made up of different-sized boulders that help create an incredible landscape framed by almost vertical cliffs and rolling hills.</p>

                            Apart from being one of the best tourist destinations, Racuh a Payaman is a protected area reserved for the conservation of local breeds of cattle.
                            Racuh A Payaman is also known as the Marlboro Hills.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Mahatao’s old, non-functional lighthouse was constructed in 1700s near the San Carlos Borromeo Church, but the structure is often overlooked in favor of the town’s modern newcomer: Tayid Lighthouse. It is crested on a hill on Batan Island, topped with a red lantern room and roof, and bears a rubble masonry base and dwelling. The similarities stop there. 
                            Tayid faces the more mischievous Pacific Ocean, not the West Philippine Sea. Its main tower is hexagonal, not round.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The province’s most iconic structure, Basco Lighthouse is one of the only two in the island and three in the entire province. (The other two are in Mahatao and Sabtang.) The six-story tower stands mightily in the middle of Naidi Hills. Naidi comes from two Ivatan words: Na, meaning “past”; and Idi, meaning “settlement.” A viewing deck circled the fifth floor, providing a fantastic view of  the West Philippine Sea and the town proper.
                            Basco Lighthouse was erected in 2003 at the site of the town’s former lighthouse and American telegraph facilities, which were destroyed during the war.</p>

                            Its most prominent feature is an arch, called Nakabuang Arch or Mahayaw Arch (you pick), that has become an icon of Sabtang and Batanes as a whole.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">One narrow street weaves the small settlement, lined with sinadumparan stone houses. A tiny chapel and a house mark the end of the concrete road and the start of the sandy shore. Children in the street played a version of piko; those on the beach picked up sticks to help their parents. One corner lodged tataya boats, waiting for another fishing session. 
                            The sand here is far from fine but mixed with shingles and small pebbles. The waves, ferocious as usual.</p>

                            It has no beach, sandy or otherwise, only rocky cliffs. One of the most important sites is Torongan Cave, an ancient settlement ground and is believed to where the first Austronesians who arrived from Taiwan landed around 2000 BC.
                            Itbayat is the northernmost municipality in the Philippines and is said to enjoy four seasons. </p>

                            A few meters from here rises a viewdeck that gives another stellar vista of the beaches on both sides. Massive rocks speck the surrounding waters, too. The ruins of the old USCG LORAN Station (Long Range Naval Station), set to be opened as a museum, are also within easy reach from here. 
                            The station was the center of what used to be Little America during the American era.</p>

                            In a province that boasts virtually ZERO crime rate, stealing is almost unheard of.</p>

                            Today, of course, it is open to everyone who wants a refreshing time without battling the bullying waves that are present in almost every beach in Batanes.
                            Just a short walk away is the so-called White Beach, with gentler waves and shallower waters (compared to other beaches in the island).</p>
